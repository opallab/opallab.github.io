# Open positions

We are always looking for highly motivated and hard-working new group members!

You will have the chance to work on important challenges in graph-based machine learning from a theoretical and practical perspective. In particular, you will work on developing new optimization models and new optimization algorithms for machine learning problems that take into account relational information among data. You will work on analyzing worst-case performance of the formulation and algorithms that are being developed and you will work on parallelizing existing and new optimization algorithms.

The University of Waterloo regards equity and diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for all employees. As such, we encourage applications from women, persons with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, members of visible minorities, and others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas. At Waterloo, you will have the opportunity to work across disciplines and collaborate with an international community of scholars and a diverse student body, situated in a rapidly growing community that has been termed a “hub of innovation.”
